<p>&#x2022; Stock market price prediction is a specific application of time series forecasting that aims to predict future prices of individual stocks or market indices. It is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of financial markets. While no prediction method can guarantee accurate results, various approaches are used in stock market price prediction, In this Project we have used Time Series Model ARIMA for forecasting</p>

### `ARIMA Pipline:`

<p>&#x2022; One of the essential step of Time Series analysis is to ensure that the data is in a regular time series format with equal time intervals.</p>
<p>&#x2022; Building a Machine learning model for Stock Forcasting using Python and Time Series forecasting models.</p>
<p>&#x2022; The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is a popular time series forecasting technique that can be used to predict future values based on historical data.</p>
<p>&#x2022; The aim of this project is achieved by performing the various data analysis methods and by using Time Series forcasting techniques we'll Predict future values and build forecasting model</p>
